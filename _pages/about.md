I am a last year Communication Systems MSc student in the [Information Processing Group](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/ic/ipg/) at [Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), where I am fortunate to work as an [IC Research Scholar](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/ic/education/master/research-scholars/) under the supervision of [Yanina Shkel](https://theory.epfl.ch/yanina/). I also had the chance to collaborate with [Ibrahim Issa](https://www.aub.edu.lb/pages/profile.aspx?memberId=ii19), [Adway Girish](https://adwaygirish.github.io/) and [Emre Telatar](https://people.epfl.ch/emre.telatar).

My research interests are in mathematical aspects of information and coding theory, theoretical computer science, and statistics. In general, I tend to enjoy topics related to the interplay between construction and randomness. My research so far was focused on i) maximal leakage and information measures and ii) distributed hypothesis testing.

I am currently working as a research engineer in the Advanced Wireless Technology Laboratory, Huawei Paris Research Center, headed by [Jean-Claude Belfiore](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/jcbelfiore). Previously, I was as a research assistant in [CHILI Lab](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/chili/fr/chili/), where I developed StaticsVR, a VR application designed to teach statics to carpentry students, under the supervision of [Richard Lee Davis](https://www.kth.se/profile/rldavis).
